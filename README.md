# Hi 👋, I'm Aditya Jayarama Lolla

**Computer Science Student at SJSU | AI/ML Developer | Web Engineer | Data & Systems Enthusiast**

## 🚀 What I'm Building

Currently developing **Petspace**, an AI-powered pet care platform using computer vision to track pet behavior and well-being.  
I’m exploring scalable deployment with **Docker, FastAPI, AWS**, and **Vertex AI**, pushing towards production-ready model pipelines and efficient MLOps practices.

I also work on projects that bridge **machine learning** and **full-stack systems**, applying data-driven insights to real-world performance optimization.

## 💡 Interests & Focus

- AI/ML Systems: Computer Vision, Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning  
- Scalable Web Engineering: API Design, Cloud-Native Apps, Real-Time Data Pipelines  
- Human-Centered AI: Linguistics, NLP, and User Experience Optimization  
- Quantitative Systems: Data Analytics, Fintech, and Statistical Modeling  

## 🧠 Projects

**UnCartify Extension** — Reduced checkout friction by 40% across 100+ beta users through automated cart processing using JavaScript and AI agents. Integrated **Supabase**, **Chrome APIs**, and **Jest** tests for secure, performant user flows.

**Yfinance Analytics Platform** — Accelerated stock data processing by 35% using **Flask REST**, **Redis caching**, and **React**. Designed real-time visualizations and pipelines handling over 1M records for live insights.

## 👔 Experience

**EON** (Software Developer Intern, San Diego, CA)  
Built scalable e-commerce systems with **React**, **Three.js**, and **Node.js**. Improved team velocity by 20% with automated Python-based task allocation tools using GitHub API integrations and AWS deployment.

**Homie AI** (Growth Intern, San Francisco, CA)  
Automated AI-driven user engagement campaigns using **Python**, **OpenAI API**, and **Google Analytics**. Increased user engagement by 20% and conversion rate by 12% through data analytics and A/B testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Go  
**Backend:** Node.js, Flask, FastAPI, Express.js  
**Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI  
**ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, YOLOv5, OpenCV  
**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase  
**Cloud/DevOps:** AWS, GCP, Docker, GitHub Actions  
**Developer Tools:** VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ, Figma, Datadog  

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced MLOps using AWS and Vertex AI  
- Multimodal AI applications combining computer vision and NLP  
- Real-time systems engineering using WebSockets and serverless architectures  

## 🏎️ Beyond Code

When I’m away from my screen, I enjoy playing tennis, watching Formula 1, exploring new technology, and discovering great food spots. I’m also fascinated by the intersection of **AI and language**, combining my **minor in Linguistics** with applied AI projects.
