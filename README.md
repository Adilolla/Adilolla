## 🚀 What I'm Building

I’m currently developing **Petspace**, an AI-powered pet care platform using computer vision to track pet behavior and well-being.  
Exploring scalable deployment with **Docker**, **FastAPI**, **AWS**, and **Vertex AI** — pushing towards production-ready model pipelines and efficient **MLOps** practices.

I also love building projects that bridge **Machine Learning** and **Full-Stack Systems**, applying **data-driven insights** to real-world performance optimization.
